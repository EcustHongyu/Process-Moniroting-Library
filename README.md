# Process-Moniroting-Library
This is an open-source library for researchers in process monitoring

We provide a variety of machine learning and deep learning models for process monitoring, including PCA, KPCA, DPCA, DKPCA, SFA, and Transformer.

All machine learning methods are implemented as subclasses of nn.Module, making it simple and convenient to develop your own models.

More models will be added in the future.
